![awb](https://github.com/HermiTech-LLC/WB-Viz/blob/main/AWB.PNG)

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive study of the Alcubierre Warp Drive, a theoretical model in physics for faster-than-light travel within general relativity. The study encompasses theoretical foundations, mathematical formulations, and interactive visualizations, offering a rich understanding suitable for both academic and practical exploration.

## Document Structure

The Markdown document consists of various sections:

- **Theoretical Background**: Introduces the Alcubierre Warp Drive, its scientific basis, and the concept of a warp bubble.
- **Mathematical Formulation**: Delves into the equations and calculations that underpin the warp drive concept.
- **Non-Uniform Grid Generation**: Discusses a method for creating detailed visualizations in specific areas, critical for modeling the warp bubble.
- **Static Visualization**: A predefined 3D representation of the warp bubble, demonstrating the model with set parameters.
- **Interactive Experimentation**: Enables users to manipulate key variables of the warp drive equation, providing a hands-on approach to understand the model's dynamics.
- **Conclusion and Further Research**: Summarizes the study and suggests directions for additional investigation.

## Getting Started
