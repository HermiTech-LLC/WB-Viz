# Interactive 3D Visualization of Alcubierre Warp Bubble

## Overview

This project offers an interactive 3D visualization of the Alcubierre Warp Bubble, a concept from theoretical physics proposing a method of faster-than-light travel within the framework of general relativity. It utilizes Python and various libraries to enable users to dynamically adjust parameters and visualize the effects on the warp bubble.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab environment
- Key Python libraries: NumPy, Plotly, and ipywidgets

### Setting Up

To set up the project, ensure you have Python installed, and then install the necessary libraries (NumPy for numerical computations, Plotly for 3D visualization, and ipywidgets for interactive controls).

## Usage

1. Open your Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Import the necessary Python libraries as specified in the project's dependencies.
3. Utilize the provided functions for creating the non-uniform grid, calculating the Alcubierre metric, and setting up the interactive visualization.
4. Execute the notebook to display the default visualization of the Alcubierre Warp Bubble.
5. Use the interactive sliders to adjust parameters like the warp factor, ship radius, and sigma value to explore different configurations of the warp bubble.
